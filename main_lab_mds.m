%% DATA: You need to download the data available at
% https://www.dropbox.com/s/afov03u64es4980/MDS_data.zip
% A link is also available on canvas


%% TOPIC DISCUSSED TODAY:
% - Organize your code vs. data
% - Shortcuts
% - Command line vs. script vs. function
% - Refresher on variables
% - Basic image visualization
% - The mdscale command
% - More on indexing ? ':'
% - Basic ploting 
% - The linkage and dendrogram functions

%% Initial cleanup
close all;
clear all;
clc;

%% Select the data you want to load and load the data
% data_file is in a format called char array The data have
% already been preformated for you in a format that matlab can
% understand ? next time we will talk about data import
%% Q: You will have to modify the line below to load different kinds of data
data_file = '../MDS_data/abstractnumbers.mat';
load(data_file)

%% Q: Use the whos command to find out what variables get loaded 

%% The data provided are a little inconsistent, the files all
% contain sim matrixes, some also contain dissim matrixes, some
% have dissimilarity measures but some don't ? just to be safe we
% will create/overwrite a dissimilarity matrix from similarity
% data
d = 1-s;

%% Q: Visualize the dissimilarity matrix using the 'imagesc' command
% You should also learn about the colormap and colorbar commands
% the axis command

%% Run non-metric MDS, we will start with 2D...
% The first argument that the function takes is a dissim (or sim
% matrix) the second one is the number of dimensions you want the
% mental space to be
Y = mdscale(d,2);

%% Q: Use the 'figure' command to start a new figure


%% Q: Use the 'plot' command to visualize the recovered mental space

%% Q: Label the axes using the 'xlabel' and 'ylabel' commands and
% add a title with the 'title' commands --  Remember to always label
% the figures axes and to always add a title

%% Here we call the 'hold on' command to tell matlab to hold on
% the current plot to add onto it
hold on;

% Q: Use the 'text' command to add labels to the datapoints on your plot at location (x,y)
% Shifted the x or y location by some small amount to improve readability

%% Here we call the 'hold off' command when we are done with the
% figure (just a good habit)
hold off;

%% Q: Open another figure

%% Q: Use the function pdist to recover the distances between
% points in mental space and plot these distances against the
% original similarity data Shepard'style


%% Q: Run hierarchical clutering on your dissim data using the
% 'linkage' function -- you will have to first format your dissim
% data using the 'squareform' command provided below.
D = squareform(d);
Z = linkage(D);
dendrogram(Z, 'labels', labs);

% save your figures using the print command
